## Project Title: 
Task Manager

## Description: 
This is a task management program from keeping track of users and their tasks. It asks a user to login with their username and password credentials. After login, a user can...
* view all tasks
* view only their own tasks
* register a new user 
* generate reports
* display statistics
* add tasks.

##Â Installation: 
Username 'admin' and password 'adm1n' are valid login credentials. All other credentials are listed in users.txt. Tasks are in tasks.txt, some are included already to demonstrate functionality.

## Uses: 
Any organisation that does anything could use this. It's a simple, no-nonsense task manager that works well straight out of the box.
