# MugillaGurilla

I'm a software engineer with experience in...
* Python
* C++ 
* GUIs
* SQL
* Django
* OOP
* Git (what gave it away?)
* NLP
* Web Dev - CSS, .js, HTML

Talk is cheap though, so I encourage you to check out my projects. 

Disclaimer: I've done the score, SFX and programming of both for a number of game projects, they're in the 'Music to Video_mp4' folder. Not strictly software engineering, but feel free to check them out.
